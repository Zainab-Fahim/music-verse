## ðŸ’¡Inspiration
Today itself we think to build a project on a daily life problem i.e, I am a bit sure you guys also face. Like most of us listen to music when our mood was not good and when we are so happy. So we need to search for the song on different platforms like Spotify and others. Now by using MusicVerse, we don't need to type the song, it will play a song on the basis of facial expression. Other than that we have a chatbot and an email suggestion system. Using chatbot you can learn more about the world of music. Email Suggestion will suggest you the music according to your mood. We also have a Twilio messaging feature that will find your nearest music store.

## âš™ What it does
MusicVerse has a chatbot and an email suggestion system. Using chatbot you can learn more about the world of music. Email Suggestion will suggest you the music according to your mood. We also have a Twilio messaging feature that will find your nearest music store. We also have a facial expression music suggestion system that will suggest the music according to your mood and play music accordingly.

## ðŸ›  How we built it
- For Frontend and Graphics we use Wix, Canva, Figma, and other designing tools.
- We used Twilio functions, to host serverless function, through which we made an axios API call to the Google Maps API to find the nearest music store. 
- We used `wix-windows` through Velo on our Wix site to get the location coordinates, through which we sent the nearest music store locations
- For the Backend, we use Flask and Velo to store all the content and updated it in real-time 
- It is our first time working with Velo by Wix and it was worth it to try it out, even though it wasn't easy 
 to use it. but we were all really interested in learning - so this weekend, we committed to it!

## ðŸ’ª Challenges we ran into
- It is our first time building a website with Velo by Wix. At first, we planned to add some great features, 
   But we are unable to do so due to lack of time.
- We had a difficult time implementing the text overlay on the image as well, and it was hard to make a 
  fully responsive UI.
- Twilio for sending messages to the user about the nearest music places.
- We feel a lot of issues in deployment on Heroku. But in the end, we are not able to do it.

## ðŸ“ŒAccomplishments that we're proud of
- Well, we built a whole social platform in 7 hours!! That's the biggest achievement of this hackathon.
- Able to build the app on Velo by Wix that really solves the issue.
- We try our best.

## ðŸ“š What we learned
- Learned more about Wix, Velo, Twilio, Google Maps API, Tensorflow, OpenCV, and Heroku. Learned a lot more about responsive designs on Wix.

## âš™ What's next for later
- Scaling to hundreds of thousands of users and UX improvements!
- Making the code Open Source and engaging different People.
